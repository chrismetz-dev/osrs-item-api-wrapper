# osrs-item-api-wrapper

This is a project that intends to make it easier to access and use the OSRS wiki live pricing api (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices) and the official grand exchange website (https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/).

**This version of the project is unstable and subject to change at any time.**
